## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to make restaurant management easier and improve the dining experience for customers. Managing menus, products, and reservations manually can be difficult for staff, and customers often struggle to find menus or book tables easily. This project solves these problems by providing a simple and efficient system for both admins and customers.

## How It Works

### Admin Side

The admin logs into the system using secure authentication. Once logged in, the admin can:

*   Manage categories by adding, viewing, and searching them to organize the menu.
*   Handle products, including adding, updating, deleting, and searching for menu items.
*   Review reservation requests from customers and approve or reject them to efficiently manage table bookings.

### Customer Side

Customers also log in securely to access their features. Once logged in, they can:

*   Browse the entire menu with ease.
*   Search for specific products on the menu.
*   Request reservations for specific dates and times to book a dining table.
*   View their past reservation history for reference.

## Features

- We implemented JWT-based authentication for both admins and customers. This ensures that only authorized users can access the system and its functionalities.

In short, this project simplifies cafe management for admins and provides a seamless dining experience for customers.
